# Food-Computer
A project to create a controlled indoor growing environment using embedded systems, sensors and control

Our plan is to build a School of Electrical & Electrical Engineering (University of Manchester) prototype version of the MIT OpenAgri "Food Computer" with an idea to scaling the design out in the future.
