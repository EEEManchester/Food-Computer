This folder contains simple GUI meant to perform simple MQTT tests.
To use, just run main.py.
Don't forget to install PyQt4 and paho-mqtt.

To do:
-Proper documentation.

Bug:
The 'Disconnect' button seems to render the client unusable.
Simply restart the program to reuse it.

*extract.bat is used to convert PyQt4 Designer generated file into python file.

Commentary:
-Written in Python 3.
-The code should be straight forward. It uses APIs from PyQt4 and paho-mqtt.
